== Biography
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), under the supervision of Prof. Tsung-Yi Ho since Fall 2021. Previously, I received my M.Eng. and B.Eng. from Fuzhou University in 2021 and 2018, respectively. I am grateful for the chance to visit Georgia Tech under the supervision of Prof. Sung Kyu Lim and NTHU under the supervision of Prof. Ting-Chi Wang. My current research interest is mainly in Electronic Design Automation (EDA), especially EDA for 3D IC and advanced packaging.
